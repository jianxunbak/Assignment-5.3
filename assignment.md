# Assignment

## Brief

In this assignment, modify the two popular navigation components to use the `navigate` and `route` props to allow passing of data between screens:

1. [Tab Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/tab-based-navigation)
1. [Drawer Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/drawer-based-navigation)

Pass information such as a login name and email between the screens.

Recall the concept where each `Screen` lives within a `Stack`, and the `Stack` within a `Container`. In a Tab Navigation, each screen can function as a `Stack` that contains multiple `Screens` within it. In a Drawer Navigation, it is much straightforward.

This assignment will expose you to the Tab and Drawer navigation, which will be helpful for the scoping of your project by giving you an idea how it works.
